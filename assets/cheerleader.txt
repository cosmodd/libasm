[Intro]
(Got the O-O, fired up)

[Verse 1]
There's no doubt
I can tell you're acting your heart out
And she's addicted
Obsessed like, "I know I can fix him" (Oh)
She's got hearts in her eyes
And she draws me kissing other guys
Her love, the type
Where she don't know where to draw the line (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Cheerleader
Thought she needed me, but I need her
(Oh, baby, you tell me, you're singing)

[Chorus]
It's not fair
'Cause I knew you like the back of my hands
Well, don't you care? I gave you everything, ah
Now I feel you even when you're not there

[Verse 2]
It's kinda sad how
It's not your fault you're living in a madhouse
I can't back down
Aren't you tired of blending into the background? (Oh)
She's got hearts in her eyes
Saying, "Boy, you better watch the time
'Cause if you're not mine
I'd rather see you burned alive," oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Cheerleader
Says she hates me 'cause I'm not hers
(Oh, baby, you tell me, you're singing)

[Chorus]
It's not fair
'Cause I knew you like the back of my hands
Well, don't you care? I gave you everything, ah
Now I feel you even when you're not there

[Bridge]
Somehow, I don't even know what she does now
Well, do I wish her the best or do I actually miss her?
She had hearts in her eyes
She was rooting for me all the time
Her love, the type
That makes you dedicate your life
Oh, my cheerleader
Thought she needed me, but I need her

[Chorus]
It's not fair
'Cause I knew you like the back of my hands
Well, don't you care? I gave you everything, ah
Now I feel you even when you're not there
Yeah, I feel you even when you're not there
